# qLearning

The goal of this project is to train a NXT robot to learn how to walk.
We use a technology called "[qLearning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)".

The (sadly no longer maintained) [nxt-python](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python) library is used to control the robot & read the sensors. The roboter creates a brain, which is then stored so that it can be used again later.

This is one of many projects made by GalileoRobotics. If you would like to learn more about us, visit [galileorobotics.ch](http://www.galileorobotics.ch/) (website in German).
